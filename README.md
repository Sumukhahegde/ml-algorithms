# ML Algorithms 
  - This is a learning project and I will post here the most common 
    machine learning algorithms applied on common data.
  - One of the folders (raw) will have code which will not use any 
    machine learning framework (sklearn etc.,) and will build the 
    algorithms from scratch.
  - In case you find the excercise useful give your feedback.
