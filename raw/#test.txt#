This program implements a decision tree algorithm from scratch 
using only numpy.

The data used is also created here, basically we create a data set 
with 100 rows and 5 columns. The values for the first four columns (features)
are drawn from a uniform random generator.
In order to get the target columns we do the following:
- add the values of all the features and call that y0
- now compute the mean of y0
- for all the rows if y0 < mean set y = 0 else y = 1
There is nothing special about this data. Once can create or use
any data the only condition is that the target column should be only 0 and 1 

This is only a wire frame model and for the actual case we need to add 
a lot of meat.
